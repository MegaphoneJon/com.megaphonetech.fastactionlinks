# Installation

Fast Action Links can be installed from within CiviCRM from the extension directory: **Administer menu** > **System Settings** > **Extensions**, on the "Add New" tab. Find, download and install the extension.

For best results, you'll also want a copy of CiviRules installed.  Install using the same steps.

After installation, you should have a new menu option available at the CiviCRM **Administration menu** > **Customize Data and Screens** called **Fast Action Links**.  See screenshot:
